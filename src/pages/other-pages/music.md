    # Live Music


    ### Friday


    The Bayou City Outlaw Band


    The Bayou City Outlaw Band was such a hit last year we're having them back!


    ### Saturday


    Thom Shepherd and Coley McCabe


    Thom and Coley and their dog Odie the Roadie travel the world telling their stories, and singing their songs that make people laugh and cry.  They were both writing for Nashville publishing companies in the same building when they met. Their first date was a Deryl Dodd show at the Blue Bar in Nashville on April Fools Day, 2011. They relocated to Texas later that year and were married by Elvis in Las Vegas on October 23rd, 2015.


    ### Sunday


    Dale & Waylon


    Always focused on dynamics and harmony, Dale & Waylon provide an intimate show with songs that were "lived in" and "lived through".  Two guitars, a mandolin, and a harmonica, provide the soundtrack to a Dale & Waylon duo show.  The addition of Dave Gould on stand-up bass, Rob Clift on keys, accordion, and steel drum, and Mike Winters on drums rounds out the Dale & Waylon full band experience.
